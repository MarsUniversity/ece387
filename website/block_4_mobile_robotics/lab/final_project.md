# Final Project

So the idea here is this will leverage everything you have learned up to this
point in one massive project. This project will leverage your  ability to:

- Control the Roomba
- Navigate and path plan
- Use computer vision to recognize and decode AR markers

## Authorized Resources

You may only get help within your group or from the instructor. Do not talk to
other groups or other cadets about this lab.

# [25 pts] Individual Score

You will take a XX min written test based on the entire course. It will be similar
to the quizzes, GRs, and have lab content. There will be questions on Linux
commands and python programming.

Why??? Well, this is to make sure everyone has been learning the material. This
is the only way to separate out people who have not been doing work.

# [25 pts] Navigate the Maze

Your robot must be able to safely navigate the maze using the cliff and bump
sensors. The maze will be dynamic, so you cannot cheat like you can in ECE382
and just program your robot to go through the maze.

# [25 pts] Correctly Identify AR Markers

Markers are located around the maze, you must be able to identify them and
react accordingly. The following marker definitions:

- 1122 something
- 2233 something
- 3344

# [25 pts] Presentation

You must provide a 5 minute presentation on lesson 40 that covers:

- Your solution, software architecture, how you solved the problems
- Issues
- What you leaned
- Suggestions for the future on the final project
