    "It is important for robots to be able to travel from one place to another. In order to determine where the robot is, we typically asign 2 reference frames. A global (e.g. inertial frame) so we can understand the dynamics of the robot and a body frame to understand what the orientation of the robot is relative to the global frame. Also, remember in a previous lesson, we talked about **pose**, which is the position and orientation of something relative to aother frame.\n",
