    "When we derive the equations of motion (EoM) for a robot, we will notation like the following:\n",

    "| | |\n",
    "|-----------|--------------|\n",
    "| $x$       | position     |\n",
    "| $\\dot x$  | velocity     |\n",
    "| $\\ddot x$ | acceleration |\n",
    "\n",
    "where $x$ is often referred to as a state variable, although it could be any letter of the alphabet or a Greek mathematical symbol. If we take the time derivative of that variable with respect to time, we get velocity. If we take the derivative a second time, we get acceleration. Throughout, we will try to differentiate between a coordinate systems' x and y values and a robot's state variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Coordinate Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important for robots to be able to travel from one place to another. In order to determine where the robot is, we typically asign 2 reference frames. A global (e.g. inertial frame) so we can understand the dynamics of the robot and a body frame to understand what the orientation of the robot is relative to the global frame. Also, remember in a previous lesson, we talked about **pose**, which is the position and orientation of something relative to aother frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"pics/robot-frame.png\" width=\"400px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Another things to note is how the body frame is oriented. There is no standard way *generally*, however, most systems use the x-direciton of the body axis as forward. Then for aerospace tyically the y-axis goes out the right wing and z-axis points down. Others dislike the z-axis pointing down, so they orient the y-axis out the leftside of the body and now the z-axis points up. There is not advantage or disadvantage with these, just personal preference.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"pics/body.png\" width=\"400px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "For our work with the roomba, we the only orientation we are concerned about is *yaw* (about the z-axis) which is typically associated with a cardinal (or compass) direction. We will represent the robot's pose (or also known as *state*) as (see Siegwart, eqns 3.1 - 3.2):\n",

    "By tracking how far each wheel moves, we should be able to determine if a robot is going straight forward, turning to the left in reverse, or whatever. Unfortunately, wheels slip, expecially when it turns, and the distance travelled becomes corrupted. This leads to errors in the true angle of the turn and leads to the following:\n",

    "\n",
    "The Mars rover uses video odometry to calculate its pose. Stereo cameras identify common features to track (like we did earlier in the vision block) in both the left and right camera. Then computed each feature's 3d position and tracked it from frame to frame to determine the distance and velocity travelled. With proper camera systems, lots of calibration and math, these types of systems are very good."
