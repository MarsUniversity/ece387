    "\n",
    "For this class we are using an iRobot Create 2 as our robot base. This robot is equiped with several sensors, but the ones we will use the most are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- IR Sensors\n",
    "    - Cliff detectors that detect the floor or the lack of one in the case of stairs\n",
    "    - Bump detectors (really they are proximity sensors)\n",
    "- Bump detectors which are switches that detect physical impact on the front\n",
    "- Encoders which return the amount of wheel rotation for the left and right wheels\n",
    "- Internal sensors for voltage and current\n",
    "    - NiMH battery pack with 19 Ahr capacity. You can actually read this and determine how drained the Roomba is.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Infrared Proximity\n",
    "\n",
    "Infrared sensor are a very common type of proximity sensor. They basically send out a beam of modulated infrared light and looks for the returned signal. Sharp makes a wide range of IR sensors for various commercial applications with detection distances ranging from 2 cm to 6 m.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"pics/ir_sensors.jpg\" width=\"300px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "These sensor return a voltage that corresponds to a measured distance. The typical\n",
    "sensor curve is shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"pics/ir_range_curve.png\" width=\"400px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "- IR Issues\n",
    "   - IR sensors are suseptable to being washed out by sunlight\n",
    "   - Multipath: IR light from one sensor could be seen by another if the sensors are misaligned or the light bounces off a reflective surface\n",
    "   - IR works best against surfaces that are orthogonal to the sensor, bright surfaces, and reflect IR. *Note:* cardboard is IR transparent, therefore you will not get a reflection off standard brown cardboard box material.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quaditure Encoders\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, the Create doesn't have really good encoders like what \n",
    "is discussed here, but this will give you an idea of how they work.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"pics/usdigital_encoder.jpg\" width=\"300px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many types of encoders, above is a US Digital encoder designed to\n",
    "be mounted on a motor shaft.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"pics/quadrature_encoder.gif\" width=\"600px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The optical encoder, shines a series of lights through an encoder disk and\n",
    "the light is detected or not detected on the other side of the encoder disk\n",
    "by some photoreceptors. A quadrature encoder has 2 signals, A and B, which\n",
    "are phased such that they are *never* high or low at the same time. Depending\n",
    "on the phase of the signals, the direction can be determined.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"pics/quadrature_animation.gif\" width=\"300px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The animation shows the signals produced from the movement of the motor\n",
    "shaft, with the encoder disk attached to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"pics/quadrature_waveform.gif\" width=\"300px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, the wave form from A and B tells us if the wheel (motor shaft\n",
    "and disk) are moving in the forward or reverse direction. Note that\n",
    "forward/reverse are arbitrary and the engineer needs to determine\n",
    "if CW or CCW is forward or reverse depending on how the sensor was\n",
    "mounted to the robot.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"pics/quadrature_resolution.gif\" width=\"300px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The resolution of the encoder is determine by how the 2 signals are\n",
    "read.\n",
    "\n",
    "- reading A and B on rising edge of A gives you the resolution of how many\n",
    "  stripes there are on the disk\n",
    "- reading on the rising and falling edge of A gives you twice the resolution\n",
    "  of the number of stripes on the disk\n",
    "- reading both A and B for both rising and falling edges gives you 4 times\n",
    "  the resolution as the number of stripes on the disk\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, obviously, the last option gives you the greatest resolution and the\n",
    "best performance ... so why wouldn't you do it? If the speed of your\n",
    "microcontroller is too slow and/or the speed of your wheel is too fast, you\n",
    "could get stuck answering interrupts all the time and never doing anything\n",
    "else. You have to balance your system constraints properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python Pseudo Code\n",

    "      count -= 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Encoder Issues:\n",
    "    - Wheel slip can cause the encoder to read more distance travelled than what the robot has actually travelled. Hence, the Mars rovers do not rely on wheel encoders to determine how far they have travelled across the Marsian sand dunes."
