    "Now we are going to start getting the Roomba to move. In order to do that, we need to program the robot correctly. Students usually are lazy and write a lazy software flow for their robot and then don't understand why things crash or don't work like they want. Once we understand the Create 2 API and program a modular/logical software flow, we will develop a simple algorithm to get our robot to do obstacle avoidance.\n",

    "There are many ways to setup how your robot's software should function. One extreme way is using the [Robot Operation System (ROS)](www.ros.org) which is not an operating system but rather an architecture for setting up a robot. On large systems, this is a good match, but there is a very steep learning curve and only runs on Ubuntu Linux.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ROS pros\n",
    "  - Free (BSD licensed) robotic architecture\n",
    "  - Distributed architecture, supports both multi-process/core and multi-machine\n",
    "    - Publish/subscribe architecture allows this flexibility\n",
    "  - C++ and python interfaces\n",
    "  - Broad academic adoption\n",
    "- ROS cons\n",
    "  - Rapid development cycle, leads to code working one year and broken due to new interfaces the next\n",
    "    - Or you can just stay on an older version of ROS, but then you loose new advancements\n",
    "  - Steep learning curve ... nothing is simple\n",
    "  - Only can develop/run on Ubuntu Linux\n",
    "  - Many packages written by Universities and are not always maintained to the current version or support is often lacking\n",
    "  - Updated annually, but core packages do not always use the most current version for libraries\n",
    "  - Complex build system with Catkin\n",
    "  - Designed for relatively powerful computers and not optimized for small embedded devices like Raspberry Pi\n",
    "  - No security, robots easily hacked\n",
    "  - Reliant on `roscore` as the central pub/sub broker, moving large amounts of data around in messages (i.e., 3D lidar point clouds, large images, etc) can introduce unnecessary delays and CPU overhead\n",

    "- **Wander:** When the robot enters into this state it starts to wander around. Basically what it does is drives froward until it encounters an obstacle. It then turns and continues forward. This basically untils forever, or until the batteries run out or someone turns the robot off.\n",
    "  - **Turing:** you can always turn in one direction (i.e., right turns) or alternate turns.\n",
    "  - **Other:** if your robot isn't able to detect obstacles very far in-front of it, you could back up a little bit first, to give the robot some room, before the robot turns.\n",

    "Let's maybe try to make it a little more robust. Now we create a couple more transitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Done:** There is some simple measureable goal we want our robot to reach. When it meets it (i.e., completely explore its environment, vacuum a room, etc), it transitions from Wander to Stop.\n",
    "- **Stuck:** basically this is saying, after so many continous turns, the robot is stuck and needs human intervention. Maybe the robot has somehow become trapped in a box and can't get out. Below was a test, where an autonomous car was designed to understand common road markers and the dashed/solid line was a typical commuter lane marker. The car knew it could cross the dotted line (ignoring the solid line) to get into the circle. However, once it was inside, the only way to get out was to cross a solid white line. This was aginst the car's programming, because commuter \n",
