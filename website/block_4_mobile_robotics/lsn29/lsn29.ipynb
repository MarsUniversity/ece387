Students usually are lazy and write a lazy software flow for their robot and then don't understand why things crash or don't work like they want. Once we understand the Create 2 API and program a modular/logical software flow, we will develop a simple algorithm to get our robot to do obstacle avoidance.\n",

    "The [Robot Operating System (ROS)](www.ros.org) is a flexible framework for writing robot software. It is a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robotic platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why? Because creating truly robust, general-purpose robot software is hard. From the robot's perspective, problems that seem trivial to humans often vary wildly between instances of tasks and environments. Dealing with these variations is so hard that no single individual, laboratory, or institution can hope to do it on their own.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](pics/ros-eco.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, ROS was built from the ground up to encourage collaborative robotics software development. For example, one laboratory might have experts in mapping indoor environments, and could contribute a world-class system for producing maps. Another group might have experts at using maps to navigate, and yet another group might have discovered a computer vision approach that works well for recognizing small objects in clutter. ROS was designed specifically for groups like these to collaborate and build upon each other's work.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](pics/ros.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- ROS pros\n",
    "  - Free (BSD licensed) robotic architecture\n",
    "  - Distributed architecture, supports both multi-process/core and multi-machine\n",
    "    - Publish/subscribe architecture allows this flexibility\n",
    "  - C++ and python interfaces\n",
    "  - Broad academic adoption\n",
    "- ROS cons\n",
    "  - Rapid development cycle, leads to code working one year and broken the next\n",
    "    - Or you can just stay on an older version of ROS, but then you loose new advancements\n",
    "  - Steep learning curve ... nothing is simple\n",
    "  - Only can develop/run on Ubuntu Linux\n",
    "      - I spent years trying to keep the macOS version running and it was painful\n",
    "  - Many packages written by Universities and are not always maintained to the current version or support is often lacking support/documentation\n",
    "  - Updated annually, but core packages do not always use the most current version for libraries\n",
    "  - Complex build system with Catkin\n",
    "  - Designed for relatively powerful computers and not optimized for small embedded devices like Raspberry Pi\n",
    "  - No security, robots easily hacked\n",
    "  - Reliant on `roscore` as the central pub/sub broker, moving large amounts of data around in messages (i.e., 3D lidar point clouds, large images, etc) can introduce unnecessary delays and CPU overhead\n",
    "     - ROS takes great pains to optimize the software and use smart data structures, algorithms, and techniques to reduce this overhead\n",
    "     - **Note:** this can also be overcome by development of few nodes and smart partitioning of algorithms. However, this is not the *default* ROS mentality\n",

    "- **Start:** The initial state. On start-up, the robot will initialize and setup some things, then immediately tranision the Wander state.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Wander:** When the robot enters into this state it starts to wander around. \n",
    "    - This basically goes on forever, or until the batteries run out or someone turns the robot off. Although this might sounds useless, this is actually useful. If a robot has the ability to map its world, but doesn't start off with a map (maybe it just landed on Mars), wandering around and \"seeing the sights\" is a great way to map the world.\n",
    "    - Wander could always just head in one direction, or maybe it randomly chooses another direction after a random about of time ... who knows! What it does is up to the programmer and how complex it is.\n",
    "    - Wander *might* also decided where it wants to go based on \"holes\" in its current map\n",
    "    - Interesting fact, iRobot just announced that Roomba will begin [mapping the strength of your home WiFi](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/01/roombas-will-soon-build-a-wi-fi-coverage-map-while-they-clean/) as they move around and vacuum your house.\n",
    "- **Avoid Obstacle:** Basically what it does is checks to see if there are any obstacles or dangers around and then avoids by some means. \n",
    "  - **Turning:** you can always turn in one direction (i.e., right turns) or alternate turns.\n",
    "  - **Other:** if your robot isn't able to detect obstacles very far in-front of it, you could back up a little bit first, to give the robot some room, before the robot turns. The last thing you want is to turn and have one of your wheels drive off a cliff.\n",
    "  - As your robot and its task becomes more complex, you will probably do more than *just* a simple turn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's maybe try to make it a little more robust. Now we create a couple more transitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stop:** There is some simple measureable goal we want our robot to reach. When it meets it (i.e., completely explore its environment, vacuum a room, battery level reaches a certain level, etc), it transitions from Wander to Stop. Stop obviously does the opposite of start and cleanly turns things off. \n",
    "- **Stuck:** basically this is saying, after so many continous turns, the robot is stuck and needs human intervention. Maybe the robot has somehow become trapped in a box and can't get out. \n",
    "    - Below was a test conducted in the UK, where an autonomous car was designed to understand common road markers and the dashed/solid line was a typical commuter lane marker. The car knew it could cross the dotted line (ignoring the solid line) to get into the circle. However, once it was inside, the only way to get out was to cross a solid white line. This was aginst the car's programming, because it meant the car was not allowed to exit the commuter lane at this location. It has to wait until it sees dashed white lines.\n",
