    "Now we are going to start getting the Roomba to move. In order to do that, we need to program the robot correctly. Students usually are lazy and write a lazy software flow for their robot and then don't understand why things crash or don't work like they want. Once we understand the Create 2 API and program a modular/logical software flow, we will develop a simple algorithm to get our robot to do obstacle avoidance.\n",

    "There are many ways to setup how your robot's software should function. One extreme way is using the [Robot Operation System (ROS)](www.ros.org) which is not an operating system but rather an architecture for setting up a robot. On large systems, this is a good match, but there is a very steep learning curve and only runs on Ubuntu Linux.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ROS pros\n",
    "  - Free (BSD licensed) robotic architecture\n",
    "  - Distributed architecture, supports both multi-process/core and multi-machine\n",
    "    - Publish/subscribe architecture allows this flexibility\n",
    "  - C++ and python interfaces\n",
    "  - Broad academic adoption\n",
    "- ROS cons\n",
    "  - Rapid development cycle, leads to code working one year and broken due to new interfaces the next\n",
    "    - Or you can just stay on an older version of ROS, but then you loose new advancements\n",
    "  - Steep learning curve ... nothing is simple\n",
    "  - Only can develop/run on Ubuntu Linux\n",
    "  - Many packages written by Universities and are not always maintained to the current version or support is often lacking\n",
    "  - Updated annually, but core packages do not always use the most current version for libraries\n",
    "  - Complex build system with Catkin\n",
    "  - Designed for relatively powerful computers and not optimized for small embedded devices like Raspberry Pi\n",
    "  - No security, robots easily hacked\n",
    "  - Reliant on `roscore` as the central pub/sub broker, moving large amounts of data around in messages (i.e., 3D lidar point clouds, large images, etc) can introduce unnecessary delays and CPU overhead\n",
