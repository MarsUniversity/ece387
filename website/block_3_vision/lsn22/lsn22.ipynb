    "Rudolf Kálmán (Hungarian: May 19, 1930 – July 2, 2016) was a Hungarian-born American electrical engineer, mathematician, and inventor. He was most noted for his co-invention and development of the Kalman filter, a mathematical algorithm that is widely used in signal processing, control systems, and guidance, navigation and control. For this work, U.S. Kálmán worked as a Research Mathematician at the Research Institute for Advanced Studies in Baltimore, Maryland from 1958 until 1964. He was a professor at Stanford University from 1964 until 1971, and then a Graduate Research Professor and the Director of the Center for Mathematical System Theory, at the University of Florida from 1971 until 1992. President Barack Obama awarded Kálmán the National Medal of Science on October 7, 2009.\n",

They are especially convenient for objects which motion model is known, plus they incorporate some extra information in order to estimate the next object position more robustly.

    "## Kalman Filter - Main Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume that we have some kind of detector and that our detector is imperfect: it is prone to false positives, does not always detect objects, detects them imperfectly (does not provide exact position and scale) and its execution is costly. Let us also assume that we are tracking a single football player. After we detect the object, we want to leverage our information about the object in order to track it as robustly as we can. Our detector will give us just the location of the object so we have to use it as best as possible. In order to predict the next position of the player, we will need an object motion model (e.g. constant velocity motion, constant acceleration motion). Our detector is imperfect so there is noise in object locations, generally called measurement noise. Also, a selected motion model will not describe our player motion perfectly, so we also have noise regarding the model, called process noise. We want to estimate the next player position incorporating only the three parameters:\n",

    "**Initial state type:** The green line at the top represents an object we’d like to track, with the blue X’s marking the object's true position. We want to model motion by using a constant velocity model. Therefore, the state will include the object position and velocity in both directions. The detector gives us the noisy object's position, so the position is our measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"pics/initial-3.png\" width=\"500px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "**Initial state value:** In order to start the tracking process, we need to know the initial state x0|0 value. We also need to have the initial uncertainty which is expressed by Gaussian covariance matrix P0|0. The orange ellipse on the top represents the 2D Gaussian which describes the uncertainty in position. The initial matrix P0|0 is usually diagonal (assuming the components are not correlated), where the each component has its own uncertainty L - Gaussian sigma.\n",

    "1a) State prediction: The first step is to predict the next state by using the motion model. The next state x(t|t-1) is obtained by multiplying the previous state by the state transition matrix - F. Q denotes process noise, which must follow normal distribution since we are working with Gaussians.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"pics/predict-2.png\" width=\"500px\">\n",

    "1b) Covariance prediction: The covariance update is done by multiplying the covariance matrix from the previous iteration by the state transition matrix F (motion model) and by adding the process noise Q which can be constant. The update covariance of our prediction is wider because we are less sure about our estimate.\n",

If the model is not linear the model must be linearized in some working point, which is used in the Extended Kalman Filter. The used model models the constant 2D velocity motion model where the position is updated as: p(t) = p(t-1) + v * p(t-1) where p denotes position and v velocity; the velocity remains constant. Velocity is marked as derivative of position in time. If we had done the prediction step multiple times, the estimated positions would follow the constant velocity model (blue dots). The covariance matrix would get wider each time (blue ellipse) as our uncertainty about the object position grows.\n",

The uncertainty of the measurement appears as golden ellipse.\n",
