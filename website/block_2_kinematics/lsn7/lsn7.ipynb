    "# Kinematics of Serial Manipulators\n",
    "\n",
    "Robot arms and legs are hard to control (lots of math), but required for most robotic applications. Kinematics is the study of motion without regard to the forces which cause it. Kinematics of manipulators involves the study of the geometric and time based properties of the motion, and in particular how the various links move with respect to one another and with time.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson will talk about matrix and vector operations. A nice review of the various mathematical operators is [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_multiplication). Take a look at how you multiply 2 matrices together (Matrix Product (two matrices)) and it will give you an idea of how it works. Ultimately we will use `numpy` to do these operations for us.\n",

    "## Coordinate Frames\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to describe positions and orientations of bodies in space relative to a \"fixed\" (or inertial) frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We generally draw a simplified version of the manipulator and attach a “frame” to each rigid body\n",
    "    - The simplified version only has:\n",
    "        - *Revolute joints:* joints that rotate\n",
    "        - *Prismatic joints:* joints that move linearly (think telescoping)\n",
    "    - By combining these in various combinations, we can make anything. For example, a spherical joint (ball-and-socket like your shoulder) is generally composed of 3 co-located (not physically real) rotational joints. This makes the math easier.\n",
    "- The frame follows the serial manipulator's body\n",
    "- There's some freedom in how we choose the frame's position and orientation relative to the body\n",
    "- DH notation partially standardises, however, there are normal DH parameters and modified DH parameters. We are using modified (see reading in Craig)\n",
    "- The combination of position and orientation of a frame is its “pose” ... like in fashion, \"strike a pose\"\n",
    "\n",
    "An example (sort of) is shown below. Notice the real robot is represented as a simpler drawing of little metal bars:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](dh_pics/kuka-kr270.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The KR270 has 6 joints and is a standard industrial type robot for building cars or what not. Notice again, the wrist, is represented as 2 revolute joints co-located (on top of each other) which is not realistic."
