    "Ok, so we have our forward/inverse kinematics defined. We now need to send commands to the robot arm to make it move. The lab will cover this, but this is just a little more information on: servos, angles to PWM widths, and coordinate frame alignments.\n",

    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- understand how to convert desired joint angles into servo commands\n",
    "- understand how to compensate for real world mis-alignments\n",
    "- understand the differences between mathematical models and the real world\n",

    "\n",
    "The first thing you need to understand are the RC servos we are using are made by the millions at the lowest price point possible. Therefore, there are little differences between every servo and there is no standard input/output relationship between servos. Typically you need to calibrate your servos and determine the max/min PWM pulse needed to move your servo between 0 degrees and 180 degrees. Note, some servos turn more than 180 degrees and some turn less ... it just depends.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Parts\n",
    "\n",
    "You should already be familar with a servo from ECE382. However, a servo allows you to command a motor to turn to an angle based off internal feedback from a potentiometer. This is nice, because it does not require you to develop a control system with a feedback loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](servo-parts.jpg)\n",
    "![](servo-block-diagram.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "But how does it work? \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The servo takes in a control signal and compares that signal to the position sensor (the potentiometer in this case) which then calculates the error between the two. \n",
    "   1. If the signal and the position sensor have the same value, then the error is 0. \n",
    "   1. If they are different, then there is error in the system. \n",
    "1. The error then gets multiplied by a gain (the amp in this case) to produce a voltage. This type of control system is referred to as a *Proportional Control System*\n",
    "1. That voltage then goes to the motor and drives the motor\n",
    "   1. If the error is zero, then the motor voltage is zero and the motor stops\n",
    "   1. If there is error, then the motor will turn in proportion to the amount of error\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, these are not really standardized and every manufacturer does things a little different, but ball park PWM values are:\n",

    "## Commanding\n",
    "\n",
    "For our robot arm, we do not need to directly talk to the servo. Instead we need to send commands to a servo driver board, which will drive the servo to the correct angle and provide power/ground. Now, our software we have developed in the homeworks will generate a joint angle (in degrees or radians), but we need to turn that into a PWM signal ... how?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our servo driver board has a serial interface and expects a command in simple [ascii text](http://www.asciitable.com/) with the following format: `#0P500` where\n",
    "\n",
    "- `#` is the message start character\n",
    "- `0` is refering to servo number 0, but can be 0-5\n",
    "- `P800` is the command to position the servo at location 800, which could be between 800 and 2300.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the standard PWM counts for our servo driver board is:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Angle | PWM   | Gripper | PWM  |\n",
    "|-------|-------|---------|------|\n",
    "| 0     | 800   | Open    | 800  |\n",
    "| 180   | 2300  | Closed  | 2300 |\n",
    "\n",
    "So if I wanted to position servo 3 at 90 degrees, I would want to send `#3P1550` (1550 is half way between 800 and 2300) or I wanted to command the gripper to close `#4P2300`. \n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** For the lab you will need to develop a function (`angle2pwm(angle)` => PWM) which will take in an angle (in degrees or radians) and return the PWM width. Also, when you develop this function, you need to be able to adjust this range. The first part of the lab is calibration, where you will double check what PWM widths work best for your servos."
