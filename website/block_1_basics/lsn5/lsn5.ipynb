    "  - We will also use cryptographic keys to login to the Roomba's. This is far safer than username/password combinations (basically you are an idiot if you are authenticating using username/password).\n",
    "- During the lab, you will have to connect to the roomba's filing system like we do with the K drive. Read [Interfaceing Windoze and Linux file systems](file:///Users/kevin/github/ece387/website/www/samba.pdf) before the lab.\n",
    "  - We will be using [Samba](https://www.samba.org/) to allow Linux to talk the Windoze SMB/CIF protocol. Samba has become that standard for Linux/Unix/macOS to Windoze file integration.\n",
    "  - The other nice thing is, we can mount the roomba's file system and then edit python scripts directly in Windoze like it was a drive attached to your notebook.\n",
